                <h1 class="subtitle ">Mapping The Global Efforts To Restore The World’s Forests!</h1>
                <h3 class="h3 ">Originally published by <strong><a class="link " href="https://cleantechnica.com/author/alexco/ ">Alex Cocan</a></strong> on Planetsave/Cleantechnica</h3>
                <img src="../img/Forest.png" alt="forest ">
                <p>It is estimated that since the advent of the agricultural revolution Earth lost approximately half of its trees, and according to a recent survey as reported by Nature (the magazine), earth currently has only about three trillion trees.
                    Image by UN climatechange (some rights reserved) There are several organizations that are hard at work to plant back the three trillion trees that were lost due to deforestation, and together with the United Nations, billionaire philanthropists,
                    and many environmental activists hopefully we can restore the forests and bring that back to something like the pre-agricultural revolution period. If that happens, together with a rapid shift to renewables, we could perhaps stop global
                    warming and revert CO2 levels back to where they were a few thousand years ago. Although efforts to restore lost forest are currently in place, we are also losing approximately 10 billion trees a year due to deforestation in different
                    parts of the world. Major losses were noted in the Amazon and Indonesia, where forests are cut for either pasture lands or plantation of palm trees.

                    <strong>Want to help with planting three trillion trees?</strong> Here are some organizations you can get involved with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Switch your search engine to <strong><a class="link " href="www.ecosia.org " title="Search with Ecosia ">Ecosia</a></strong> – as of this writing, it has helped plant over 14 million trees. Ecosia is a social business which uses
                            its profits generated from searches to plant trees around the world. It aims to plant 1 billion trees by 2020. Let’s hope it exceeds at that goal!</li>

                        <li>Another of my favorites is Felix Finkbeiner and his <strong><a class="link " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant-for-the-Planet " title="Visit Plant for the Planet Wiki ">Plant for the Planet Foundation</a></strong>, with
                            a stated goal of planting one trillion trees, a true moonshot that (by conventional thinking and current methodologies) sounds like an audaciously impossible goal. Nevertheless, we’re living in the age of exponentials, so hopefully
                            technology will help us achieve that goal.</li>

                        <li><strong><a class="link " href="https://www.biocarbonengineering.com/ " title="Biocarbon Engineering ">BioCarbon Engineering</a></strong> is another enterprise, this time founded by an ex-NASA engineer. It uses drones to plant trees
                            and aims to plant billion trees a year!</li>

                        <li><strong><a class="link " href="www.earthday.org " title="Earth Day Org ">Earthday.org’s Reforestation Project</a></strong> aims to plant 7.8 billion trees, one tree for every person on earth.</li>
                        <li><strong><a class="link " hreaf="www.plantabillion.org " title="Plant a Billion Trees ">Plantabillion.org</a></strong> hopes to plant a billion trees by 2025 in Brazil, China, and the US.</li>
                        <li>The Million Tree Initiative wants to transform cities into forests.</li>
                        <li>IKEA also has a “plant a tree” program, and has to date planted 1.9 million trees.</li>
                        <li>Perhaps the most ambitious project to date is China’s Great Green Wall. To date, 66 billion trees were planted, since 1978 when the project started. The project’s end date is 2050. Looking forward to know what the final figure
                            will be!
                        </li>
                        <li>India’s tree planting initiative, with the help of 1.5 million people this year*, planted 66 million trees in 12 hours. Last year, they managed to plant 50 million trees. Impressive! (*1.5 million is the population of a moderately
                            sized city — can you imagine all the citizens of a city that size working towards the same goal?)</li>

                        <li>To aid with tree planting initiatives, the Land Life Company has patented the “Cocoon” method of tree planting and claims to be cheaper than traditional tree planting methods with a very high survival rate of 80–95%.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seeing such initiatives gives me hope in the future of humanity. Great things can be achieved if we collectively work towards the same goal! I am hopeful that by the time these trees reach maturity, approximately 20–30 years, we would have exceeded Mother
                    Nature in extracting carbon from the atmosphere and using advanced technologies to turn carbon into useful products, perhaps even building large structures or even cities out of carbon. If you know any other great organizations that
                    are planting trees, leave a comment below.

                <h2 class="subtitle ">Lab-Grown Meat Has Arrived, And It’s Good News For The Planet!</h2>
                <h3 class="h3 ">Originally published by <strong><a class="link " href="https://cleantechnica.com/author/alexco/ ">Alex Cocan</a></strong> on Planetsave/Cleantechnica</h3>

                </div>
                <p>While everyone is talking about electric cars and autonomy as a huge disruptor to the global economy, there is another elephant in the room that not many people seem to notice — lab-grown meat! A few days ago news broke that China bought
                    $300 million worth of lab-grown meat from three Israeli-based companies — SuperMeat, Future Meat Technologies, and Meat the Future. While the price per lb/kg was undisclosed, I would not be surprised if the price paid was at or below
                    farm-grown meat. I’m sure many people would like to know how long it will be until lab-grown meat floods the global market, and in order to answer that, one has to look at Ray Kurzweil’s Law of accelerating returns, which states that,
                    “for every technology, there is an exponential growth and that growth is always accelerating due to convergence of technologies (i.e. — faster computers, better hardware, AI assisted systems, etc.)” As meat production like this becomes
                    a technology, it will be subject to the “Law of accelerating returns.” Thus, growth will accelerate while the price per unit produced will decrease. Is there a Moore’s law for lab-grown meat? Probably, but I am not aware of details
                    on this subject yet. However, looking back just a few years, we have seen some insane price drops for lab-grown meat. In 2013, a burger of lab-grown meat would have cost you $325,000 excluding tips, and just two years later the same
                    lab-grown burger was only $11.36. Drawing reference from the continuous price drop in the last couple of years, it could be presumed that in 3 years, the global market could be inundated by lab-grown meat sold at ridiculously cheap
                    prices. This lab-grown meat will be antibiotic-free and hormone-free, a much healthier option when compared with farmed meat. What would that mean? Well, as with most transitions, there will be some winners and losers; however, I believe
                    that for the most part, the change will be good for the planet, animals, and people.
                    <h5>The Good</h5><br> It is estimated that about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock (estimates vary greatly depending on the assumptions). Although producing meat in the lab is quite energy intensive and could contribute
                    to global warming as well, it will be exponentially better compared with current livestock practices. A possible reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from livestock would at the barest minimum be achievable within the next 5–10 years
                    with lab-grown meat. Additionally, most intentionally deforested pasture lands as well as huge corn and soy plantations could be turned back into lush forests, as little rangeland would be needed for livestock production. This would
                    further help to trap carbon and reduce global warming. Could this be our ace in the hole to keep the temperature under 2 degrees? Possibly! In my opinion, there’s an even better outcome of the rapid expansion of the lab-grown meat
                    industry. It could be a bombshell for lab cell regeneration and cheaper recreation of human organs.
                    <h5>The Bad</h5><br> With persistent takeover by the lab-grown meat industry, lots of farms will be put to halt. This will be accompanied by loss of jobs and job insecurity. Unfortunately, the swift change will be too rapid for many policymakers
                    to take notice and implement protection measures for those affected by the change. What is your opinion about lab-grown meat? Would you eat lab-grown meat? Looking forward to your comments!

                <h2 class="subtitle ">Amazon & The Future Of Food</h2>
                <h3 class="h3 ">Originally published by <strong><a class="link " href="https://cleantechnica.com/author/alexco/ ">Alex Cocan</a></strong> on Planetsave/Cleantechnica</h3>
                <img src="../img/Farming.png" alt="Vertical Farm ">
                <p>A few months ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought Whole Foods at a whopping $13.4 billion, with a promise to bring cheap, organic, nutritious, low carbon*, and pesticide-free food to the masses. Soon after the acquisition, Whole Foods cut prices
                    by as much as 43%, bringing prices of organic food at or below non-organic food. Currently, Amazon is well established in 13 countries. With this new acquisition, Amazon gained access to 460 Whole Foods stores scattered across the
                    US, Britain, and Canada. A plan to extend further to be within 30 to 60 minutes away from as many people as possible is underway according to Mikey Vu, a partner at the consultancy Bain & Company who is focused on retail, as quoted
                    by the New York Times. What’s next for Amazon? Well, acquisition of vertical farm startups, drone delivery, and more. Let me explain. It is no secret that Amazon got the logistics of warehouses and distribution down to a science, and
                    I would argue that, after the Whole Foods acquisition, a natural next step for Amazon in order to have a complete ecosystem of organic food production, distribution, and sales would be to acquire local and/or international vertical
                    farm startups, which are popping up all over the world at an ever-increasing rate. Vertical farm startups like Plenty, AeroFarms, and Bowery recently received between $20 million to $200 million in investments from venture capitalists,
                    including Jeff Bezos — more proof that vertical farming is on Bezos’ radar. For those who are not familiar with vertical farming, here are some advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consumes 95% less water that traditional farming methods, by some estimates</li>
                    <li>Eliminates the need for pesticides Year-round crop production</li>
                    <li>Eliminates agricultural runoff High yield/acre Reduces use of fossil fuels from farm machinery and transport of food</li>
                    <li>No weather-related crop failures Creates new urban employment opportunities </li>
                    <li>Reduces the risk of infection from agents transmitted at the agricultural interface</li>
                    <li>Returns farmland to nature, helping to restore ecosystem functions and services </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As to why Amazon would venture into vertical farming? First, as mentioned above, to close the cycle and have a complete ecosystem. Moreover, vertical farming is high tech and involves storage and logistics, which fits well with Amazon’s
                    top-notch expertise in these domains. Soon, you will be able to order a fresh salad, or any organic food, from your phone on Amazon, perhaps even automatically schedule delivery every day at a desired time and have it delivered by
                    a drone or small robot directly to your door within 30 minutes. What an exciting time to be alive! What are your thoughts on vertical farming and the future of food? *Low carbon: Vertical farming is quite energy intensive. However,
                    assuming that energy is coming from a renewable source, it will be low carbon.
